    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "CIFAR-10 classification is a common benchmark problem in machine learning. The problem is to classify RGB 32x32 pixel images across 10 categories: ```airplane```, ```automobile```, ```bird```, ```cat```, ```deer```, ```dog```, ```frog```, ```horse```, ```ship```, and ```truck```.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to build a relatively small convolutional neural network (CNN) for recognizing images. In the process, this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlights a canonical organization for network architecture, training and evaluation.\n",
    "2. Provides a template for constructing larger and more sophisticated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason CIFAR-10 was selected was that it is complex enough to exercise much of TensorFlow's ability to scale to large models. At the same time, the model is small enough to train fast, which is ideal for trying out new ideas and experimenting with new techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights of the Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 tutorial demonstrates several important constructs for designing larger and more sophisticated models in TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core mathematical components including [convolution](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#conv2d), [rectified linear activations](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#relu), [max pooling](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#max_pool) and [local response normalization](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#local_response_normalization).\n",
    "- [Visualization](http://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html) of network activities during training, including input images, losses and distributions of activations and gradients.\n",
    "- Routines for calculating the [moving average](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/train.html#ExponentialMovingAverage) of learned parameters and using these averages during evaluation to boost predictive performance.\n",
    "- Implementation of a [learning rate schedule](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/train.html#exponential_decay) that systematically decrements over time.\n",
    "- Prefetching [queues](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/io_ops.html#shuffle_batch) for input data to isolate the model from disk latency and expensive image pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a multi-GPU version of the model which demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuring a model to train across multiple GPU cards in parallel.\n",
    "- Sharing and updating variables among multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this tutorial provides a launch point for building larger CNNs for vision tasks on TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model in this CIFAR-10 tutorial is a multi-layer architecture consisting of alternating convolutions and nonlinearities. These layers are followed by fully connected layers leading into a softmax classifier. The model follows the architecture described by [Alex Krizhevsky](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/), with a few differences in the top few layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model achieves a peak performance of about 86% accuracy within a few hours of training time on a GPU. Please see below and the code for details. It consists of 1,068,298 learnable parameters and requires about 19.5M multiply-add operations to compute inference on a single image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Organization\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 network is largely contained in [cifar10.py](https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10.py). The complete training graph contains roughly 765 operations. We find that we can make the code most reusable by constructing the graph with the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Model inputs](http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html#model-inputs): ```inputs()``` and distorted_inputs() add operations that read and preprocess CIFAR images for evaluation and training, respectively.\n",
    "2. [Model prediction](http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html#model-prediction): ```inference()``` adds operations that perform inference, i.e. classification, on supplied images.\n",
    "3. [Model training](http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html#model-training): ```loss()``` and ```train()``` add operations that compute the loss, gradients, variable updates and visualization summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The input part of the model is built by the functions ```inputs()``` and ```distorted_inputs()``` which read images from the CIFAR-10 binary data files. These files contain fixed byte length records, so we use ```tf.FixedLengthRecordReader```. See [Reading Data](http://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/reading_data/index.html#reading-from-files) to learn more about how the ```Reader``` class works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are processed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are cropped to 24 x 24 pixels, centrally for evaluation or [randomly](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html#random_crop) for training.\n",
    "- They are [approximately whitened](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html#per_image_whitening) to make the model insensitive to dynamic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training, we additionally apply a series of random distortions to artificially increase the data set size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Randomly flip](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html#random_flip_left_right) the image from left to right.\n",
    "- Randomly distort the [image brightness](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html#random_brightness).\n",
    "- Randomly distort the [image contrast](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html#tf_image_random_contrast).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the [Images](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/image.html) page for the list of available distortions. We also attach an ```image_summary``` to the images so that we may visualize them in TensorBoard. This is a good practice to verify that inputs are built correctly.\n",

    "Reading images from disk and distorting them can use a non-trivial amount of processing time. To prevent these operations from slowing down training, we run them inside 16 separate threads which continuously fill a TensorFlow [queue](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/io_ops.html#shuffle_batch).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The usual method for training a network to perform N-way classification is [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), aka. softmax regression. Softmax regression applies a [softmax](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#softmax) nonlinearity to the output of the network and calculates the [cross-entropy](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits) between the normalized predictions and a [1-hot encoding](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/sparse_ops.html#sparse_to_dense) of the label. For regularization, we also apply the usual [weight decay](http://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.html#l2_loss) losses to all learned variables. The objective function for the model is the sum of the cross entropy loss and all these weight decay terms, as returned by the ```loss()``` function.\n",
